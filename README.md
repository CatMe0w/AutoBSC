Want all the Starr Drops, sprays and coins, but don't have the time to watch the stream, or it just doesn't match the timezone where you live? AutoBSC is here to help you!

AutoBSC can automatically completes the events during the stream, including Cheers, Polls (choosing MVP), Quizzes and Match Predictions.

Tested on March Monthly Finals 2024, but should work on other Championship streams as well.

## Quick Start

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

2. Install AutoBSC by clicking [here](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/491375/AutoBSC.user.js).

3. Open the stream page on https://event.supercell.com/brawlstars/

4. If "AutoBSC loaded" is shown in the event logs, then it's working. Now you can just leave the tab open and let it do the work for you.

## Limitations

- Sometimes the point reading won't update and manual refresh is needed. Don't worry, AutoBSC is still working.

- Manually clicking on the polls or quizzes won't work, as AutoBSC will send the answer automatically.

- AutoBSC doesn't have a question database, so it will always choose the first option in the quizzes.
